Follow these steps strictly in order (1 → 7).  
Execute them one by one without skipping or merging.  
Always provide full file contents when creating files.  

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   https://github.com/venkatkukatla/Terraform-ai.git  

2. Create and switch to a new branch named dev.  

3. Create Terraform files in the project root:
   - main.tf
   - variables.tf
   - terraform.tfvars

   These must provision AWS resources:
   - VPC
   - Subnet
   - Route Table
   - Internet Gateway
   - Security Group
   - S3 bucket
   - DynamoDB table

4. Create a folder `/.github/workflows/` with 3 workflow files:
   - build.yml → basic syntax check (terraform validate)
   - terraform-plan.yml → runs terraform init and terraform plan
   - terraform-apply.yml → runs terraform apply (with auto-approve for CI)

5. Create `.gitignore` with rules to exclude:
   - .terraform/
   - *.tfstate
   - *.tfstate.backup
   - crash.log
   - .DS_Store

6. Create or update `README.md` with:
   - Project purpose (Terraform + GitHub Actions automation)
   - AWS resources being provisioned
   - Explanation of workflows (build, plan, apply)

7. Commit and push the dev branch to GitHub.

⚠️ Rules:
- Use commands where needed and file creation where needed.
- Provide full file content when generating new files.
- Do not skip any step. Complete each before moving to the next.
